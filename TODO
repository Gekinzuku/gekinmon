-1. Battling
2. More scripting functions
3. Rework player movement perhaps
4. Be able to move to a new area from an existing one (Somewhat implemented)
5. add res switcher
6. allow scripts to draw directly to the res or to the scale

Note on #4: I believe I need to rework the area loading system to implement this, currently it goes to "town.xml" when you hit a blue space.
But with this method, I have no way of controlling multiple exit points.
